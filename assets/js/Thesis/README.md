<h2>Pain and the Morphine Molecule: How Did Quantifying Pain Actually Silence It?</h2>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>The core of my thesis will be centered around how the opioid epidemic changed the trajectory of how we view pain. While pain has always been and remains a highly subjective human experience, regardless of how pharmaceutical companies sought to deem it the ‘5th vital sign’, that hasn’t stopped modern medicine from trying to quantify and diagnose pain itself. The arc of my thesis will ground itself in the perception of pain, beginning with historical perceptions to the evolution of opioids and how the epidemic changed our collective perception of pain. </p>

<h3>Pt. 1: The History of Pain</h3>
<p>The secularization of pain is where this story begins. Before pain could be ‘treated’, it was spiritual and thought to be divine punishment. Before treatment, religious officials and enlightenment thinkers interpreted pain through the human experience, defining it differently for gender, class, religion, and other demographic markers.  Once medicine evolved to use substances to control pain, such as opium or chloroform, the division between medicine and science grew and pain was now a symptom of illness which could be treated as such. Before we could numb our pain, we allowed it to inexplicably tell us something about ourselves.</p>

<h3>Pt. 2: The Morphine Molecule</h3>
<p>When morphine came into popular use, it was synthetically replicated into different compounds which could easily be 2, 10, or 100 times as potent its opium origin. While opioids have valid medical use, such as for end-of-life pain, pharmaceutical companies marketed their products to doctors and patients as a viable treatment option for those in moderate to severe chronic pain. Specifically, OxyContin became a household name after Purdue Pharma mis marketed its ‘slow-release coating’, claiming to be ‘nonaddictive’. Data, infographics, and studies were manipulated to make false claims that a patient wouldn’t feel the same addictive euphoria as frequently and intensely as morphine and other opioids, which were knowingly very addictive. As the saga plays out, we see pain clinics and general practitioners alike prescribing OxyContin to a much larger demographic of pain patients than necessary, and the widely available opioid ignites an epidemic which renders millions of people addicted. Given that opioids were a ‘quick fix’ with extensive damage in the long term, the numbing of pain during this time had lasting repercussions on our collective perception of pain.</p>

<h3>Pt. 3: Quantifying Pain</h3>
<p>Once pharmaceutical companies could replicate the morphine molecule, ‘the war on pain’ was initiated. To treat pain, we had to be able to quantify it. Of course, unlike blood pressure or heart rate, there was and still is not a reliable, objective way to understand pain, as each individual experiences pain differently. Vocabulary for describing pain even varies in specificity and characterization between languages, individualizing the experience even further. Despite more generative efforts, measurement by subjective report is by far the most common type of procedure for quantifying pain. Patients may indicate pain levels verbally, mark simple scales, or fill out complex questionnaires. In all cases, the patient determines the data.</p>


<h3>Pt. 4: Your Brain on Pain // This is Your Brain on Drugs, Actually</h3>
<p>Long term opioid use rewires the brain to require the synthetic opioid, leaving a user severely ill without their increase in consistent dosage. In addition, while opioids numb certain physical aspects of pain, they have proven to reduce a user’s pain threshold in long term use. The quick fix that opioids provide do not consider some of the aspects of pain that early theorizers considered, such that the body and mind are connected, and that pain is not merely physical. Rather, pain must be treated considering both the mind’s perception as well as the body’s reaction. Your mind perceives pain just as much as the body feels it, which is mildly explained in phenomena such as ‘phantom pain’ after an amputation or ‘empathetic pain’ when pain seen in one person and felt simultaneously in another.</p>

<h3>Pt. 5: Contemporary Perception of Pain</h3>
<p>Preceding widespread opioid use, pain was treated more holistically. In the aftermath of the opioid epidemic, we are left with stigma for chronic pain patients as well as mistrust in doctors. While opioids are continued to be debated in medicine and government, opioid overdoses continue to increase while pain is stigmatized with little progress made in diagnosing or objectively quantifying it. </p>
